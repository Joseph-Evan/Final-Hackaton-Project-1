      <h2>What is anger?</h2>
      <p>We all feel angry at times it's part of being human. Anger is a normal, healthy emotion.</p>

      <p>There are many different reasons why we might feel angry. We may feel anger at having been treated badly or
        unfairly by others. Our anger may be a reaction to difficult experiences in our daily life, our past, or in the
        world around us. Or it may be a way to cope with other emotions. For example, we may feel anger alongside
        feeling attacked, powerless, embarrassed or scared. Our page on causes of anger has more information.</p>

      <p>We may not know why we feel angry and that's okay too. We don't always need to justify or explain why we feel a
        certain way.</p>

      <p>Sometimes anger can be a helpful emotion. But sometimes it can be difficult to manage and make our lives
        harder.</p>

      <p>Learning how to recognise, express and manage anger can make a big difference to our mental health. Our page on
        managing your anger has some tips on how to deal with anger.</p>
